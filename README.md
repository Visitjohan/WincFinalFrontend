# This is my final project for the frontend course, about a recipe website.

## Here are my thoughts on the project:

## Things im okay about:

- Created a header and a footer feels standart to me.
- Same ingreadianst start whit “\* ” i removed that by detecting it and cut the first 2 charecters from the String

## Things im happy about:

- For the “Total cooking time I created a function to sat if its less then an hour “x minits” if it is more then just “x:xx”
- To make all the pictures the same size i used a objectfitter(not so nice), solution on my opinion shoud be found by uploading the picture with a “crop”tool like facebook does have.
- All filters work, bij writing you can find the lables, and the dropdown you can find the healthlabesls. I got a reset buton that clears evrything.
- About vegan and vegetarian, to my knolege evrything that is vegen is automaticly vegetarian, so i made a function that said nothing if it isit , vegen or vegetarian if one is listed in the "healthLabels".

## Not to hapy about:

- I think the home-page looks okay, the single-recepi-page didnt go exactly how i wanted it. Evrything is included.
- I diddnt like working with chakra UI. I experimented with bootstrap and i think its good for concept disigning, but now im working mostly directly with Tailwind and Tailwind baced libraryies like NexUI and shadcn. The homepage does resize good, the single-recipe-page doesnt, i dont know why. With tailwind i coud have done it so easy and i spend a lot of time on it. Maybe i just diddt get the chakra wey of thinking. Shoud do some more meditation.

# Hope this review meets your expectations.
