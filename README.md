# This is my final project for the frontend course, about a recipe website.

## Here are my thoughts on the project:

## Things im okay about:

- I've established a standard header and footer, which feels familiar and appropriate for the website's layout.
- I've successfully removed the initial "*" characters from ingredients by detecting and cutting the first two characters from the string.

## Things im happy about:

- Developed a function to display cooking time dynamically, presenting it as "x minutes" if under an hour and as "x:xx" otherwise, enhancing user experience.
- Maintained picture uniformity by utilizing an object fitter, although I acknowledge the potential for improvement by implementing a picture cropping tool akin to Facebook's.
- Implemented functional filters for both labels and health labels, including a reset button for user convenience.
- Simplified the distinction between vegan and vegetarian options, improving categorization efficiency by automatically identifying vegan recipes as vegetarian when health labels are present.

## Areas for improvement:

- While the homepage appears satisfactory, the single recipe page lacks the desired outcome. Though all necessary components are included, further adjustments are needed.
- Not fully satisfied with Chakra UI; after experimenting with Bootstrap, I've transitioned to Tailwind CSS and associated libraries like NexUI and Shadcn for improved design flexibility. While the homepage responds well to resizing, the single recipe page does not. This discrepancy prompts me to delve deeper into understanding Chakra's approach and perhaps explore more meditation for clarity.
- Overall, while there are aspects I'm content with and proud of in the project, there are also areas that require refinement and deeper exploration to meet my standards of excellence.

# Hope this review meets your expectations.
